# phm-dev  
This GitHub organization simply hosts personal projects related to managing PHP on macOS. It's not a company, just a place to organize code.  

## Projects  
- **PHM (PHP Manager for macOS)** – a CLI tool that makes it easy to install, switch and configure PHP versions on macOS and manage PHP‑FPM.  
- **php-packages** – a set of pre-built PHP binaries and extensions for macOS designed to be used with PHM, so you don't need to compile anything yourself.  

Feel free to use the tools or contribute if you find them useful!
